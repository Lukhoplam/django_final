Usage
=====

Once installed, you can use My Project in your Python scripts or projects.

Here is a simple example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_project import some_function

    result = some_function("Hello, Sphinx!")

    print(result)

This example imports a function called `some_function` from My Project, calls it with a string, and prints the result.
